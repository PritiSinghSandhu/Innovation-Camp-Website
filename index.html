          <aside class="right-box">
              <p> In collaboration with Save The Children, our goal is to reach the sustainable development goal number 4.
              "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunites for all."

              <br>
              Why is it important to track attendance and absenteeism in school?
              It will be difficult to know how many and why some students are absent from school,
              if we do not control on it and data about it. We

              How can attendance and enrolment data prevent dropout in school?
              How can technology play a role in solving this issue?
              <br>
              <br>
              We fear many children will not return to school.
              We do not have good enough data on why children are out of school.
              We do not use the data efficiently.
              The data do not reach someone that can do something about it.
              <br>
              <br>
              But the questions we need to take into consideration are "What technology to use?" "What data to collect?" "Who needs to be involved?" "What context will this be used?" and "Are there any risks?"

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
              </div>
              <aside class="right-box">
                    <p> We have chosen to create a product for students and teachers in Ethiopia. We are based on schools in the country that have access to technology like the internet and a form of computer.
                      The internet gives the teacher easy access and it is not difficult to store and retrieve data. This idea involves both students and teachers, as well as state officials to process data and people to help with contacting absent students.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The teacher is assigned a user on the website and logs in at the start of the class. The first time in use, all current students are added to the system.
                    After a while we get enough data for the teacher to easily address the absence and get an overview of who is, and is not, present. The data obtained would include students' names, which day the absence started, how long the student has been away and reason(s) for the absence.
                    Data on the student's health, both physically and mentally, will be collected. This is because there are both physical and mental reasons for not being able to go to school.
                    Other personal information will be about family and friends, as well as gender, age and class. There are also problems that can prevent the student from attending school or to categorize more easily in a database.
                    This will give the teacher an easy way to take attendance (by filling in the table), but also give us an overview of the absence in the national database when uploaded.
                    Then the country will have a way to overview absences from their schools (both locally and nationally), map out trends and have an idea of which problem occurs to most students. This information can be visualized by a table. They can now initiate preventive measures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We would suggest having absence managers at schools around the country who can track the students by contacting their guardians, friends, or travel to the students' homes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This idea could give an overview over the most vulnerable, for example the physically and mentally sick, and give the country a chance to take measures to get them back to school.
                    It is important to acknowledge the the risk factors of this idea. Obtaining private information might be a privacy issue. The ones who need to be involved could possibly not want to share information about their situation or give false information.
                    But to solve this problem we will use the absence managers efficiently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>What technology to use?</strong></em> Because we decided to create a website, this solution will mainly work on websites and will also be compatible with smartphones.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>What data to collect?</strong></em> For the system to be sucsessfull, we need to collect general infomration about the students such as their name, date of birth, address and general information about their families
                    As well as we need the students medical information, so that the teachers will have an overview of the situation the student is in.
                    <br><br>
                    <em><strong>Who needs to be involved?</strong></em> A lot of the collected information is very sensitiv, we have to make sure that only the people who are directly involve wit the students have access to this. Therefore the information should
                    only be available for the teahers of the student, the students themselves, their guardians and the principle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>What context will this be used?</strong></em> This information will be used to help reduce the absence from school by finding out the main reason, and wokring wiht that. If the student is abcent because of a medical issue, the
                    teachers can make another arrangement for the student, so that they will be able to study from home. This will also help to keep more students in school.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>Are there any risks?</strong></em> Unfortunately there are many risks to this. Even if the information is only supposed to be for those who are involved, it might still come into the hands of someone else and be misused. so we need to create a system that makes is
                    extra secure and safe.
